>**The surest indicator of a great nation is represented not by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but by the general welfare of its people.**

## position: generally by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists

    1 great nation established by powerful leader often sacrifice the well-being of ordinary people
1.1 **Egypt**  
make great contribution to civilization of the world, but it is based on the miserable life of hundreds of slaves  
1.2 **Soviet Union**  
defeat Nazi, end the war. while it force man in country to  fulfill mandatory military service/ use money to develop advanced weapon, neglect their people is starving  

    2 leader is powerful that can improve people's welfare
2.1 **science**  
no science -> no weapons -> not be able to defend ourselves(china nuclear bomb)  -> be passive in internation relations and game -> subject to other  nations
2.2 **artist**  
art -> spiritual need -> museum, concert -> broaden our horizon/expericence exotic culture/know more about the world/feel the world/let off steam -> otherwise people is nerd adn stressed out

    3 (让步) elite politics cannot make the country great if there are severe stratification
3.1 **living condition**  
3.1.1 Asian country like india  
3.2 **political status**  
3.2.1 middle afraican women be centered at home, no political rights at all.

>**Leaders are created by the demands that are placed on them.**  

## postition: agree to a limited extent

    1 pos: democracy system require leader to meet demand
1.1 **election**
voters will elect whose view squre with themselves (who hate feminist or Afracan American) 
1.2 **administrative mechanism**
The United Kingdom European Union membership referendum
the political structure makes the leader sometimes act accroding to public opinion, a mirror of it.

    2 neg: leaders' own choice
2.1 **desire and outlook**
when the mass hold different opinions to an issue, leaders need to make choice for them

2.2 **controlled by money**
rising cost of campaign -> leaders seek financial support(In 2008, Barack Obama and John McCain together received and spent more than $1 billion on their presidential campaigns) -> organizations supplying cash to politicians expect to be treated favorably in return -> policies will lean to them

    3 neg: leaders' capability
