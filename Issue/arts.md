>**Some people believe that government funding of the arts is necessary to ensure that the arts can flourish and be available to all people. Others believe that government funding of the arts threatens the integrity of the arts.**
## position: government funding of the arts threatens the integrity of the arts.
    1 
1.1 **ancient china**  
1.1.1 emperor aprropriate every valuable antique as royal collection, it belongs to and only available to royal members  
1.1.2 discourage the motivation to create masterpiece. even created, cant share, afraid of being appropriated  

1.2 **modern china**   
if the government is subverted, these artcraft will be plundered  
ex. the summer palace and the old summer palace
at the present still not retrieved   

    2
 2.1 **totalitarian**  
government funding -> propoganda -> full of statue, painting and poem that praise the dictator -> mislead others/ deviate from the truth of arts, art serve in purpose, not so pure, lose aesthetic value  

2.2 **capitalism**
fund -> become industry -> need return -> should be profitable -> the poor cant see -> follow fashion/main stream -> what need professional skill will be diminished ->  cut ordinary people from virtuosity
extra funding -> extra tax -> public adversion toward arts -> lose interest  

    3 (让步)can be conducive under some circumstances
3.1 **art school**  
fund -> get every children equality to learn arts -> help find talented students/ help poor children realize their dream   
3.2 **museum**  
no fund -> individual buyer may collect as personal collection -> some artcraft such as calligraphy and painting from the ancient is at a premium  
3.3 **abroad artcraft**  
boost cultural diversity, no communication  

80/88

>80  
>**Nations should suspend government funding for the arts when significant numbers of their citizens are hungry or unemployed.**  
>88
>**Claim: Nations should suspend government funding for the arts when significant numbers of their citizens are hungry or unemployed.  
Reason: It is inappropriate—and, perhaps, even cruel—to use public resources to fund the arts when people's basic needs are not being met.**    
## position: disagree
    1 neg: the benefit of funding1: cultural
1.1 **art school**
1.2 **keep us**

    2 neg: the benefit of funding2: cultural
2.1 **museum**
no fund -> individual buyer may collect as personal collection -> some artcraft such as calligraphy and painting from the ancient is at a premium -> gain unjustified profit and 
2.2 **absorb aboard arts**


    3 neg: art is not to blame for the poor
3.1
**pos:** if basic need can not be satisfied, no one will go to museum  
**neg:** it may be true, but 
3.1.1 if we follow this, everything apart from basic need should be halted, acedemic, environment-conservation,entertainment, obviously not true
just arrange propoerly and give it less funding instead of cutting it down
3.1.2 the poverty result from uneven distribution of resources, ex. racial, social class, gender -> education, status, if we dont eradicate these, the poor will always be poor
