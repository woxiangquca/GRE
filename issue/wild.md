## POSITION: disagree
    1:agree because limited resource
1.1 **natural selection**   
1.1.1 predator white moth in Manchester  
1.1.2 short giraffe lack of food  
1.2 **limited resource** panda  
1.2.1 food is distinctive, not easy to find food for them  
1.2.2 shelter is at a premium, not to mention human  
1.3 **not knowing the result**  
1.3.1 what if we cant save? then we waste our resource  
1.3.2 what if there are side effect  

    2:disagree because food cycle  
2.1 **good conditions: forest**  
if protect-> the thing that it prey at will be stable  
green algea will grow fast if no predator  
2.2 **extreme conditions: frozan land and dessert**  
only consist of very few species, if dont protect, its   predator will vanish and so do its predatoe of its predator
chain reaction
