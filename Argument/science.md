>**The following appeared in a memo from the director of a large group of hospitals.**
>
> **In a laboratory study of liquid antibacterial hand soaps, a concentrated solution of UltraClean produced a 40 percent greater reduction in the bacteria population than did the liquid hand soaps currently used in our hospitals. During a subsequent test of UltraClean at our hospital in Workby, that hospital reported significantly fewer cases of patient infection than did any of the other hospitals in our group. Therefore, to prevent serious patient infections, we should supply UltraClean at all hand-washing stations throughout our hospital system."**

    1
M: report fewer infection  
A: UC good -> fewer infection  
P: UC is the only remedy  
S: skillful doctor/advanced equippment/good sanitation  

    2
M: W report fewer infection  
A: report fewer -> in fact fewer  
P: W small hospital, not many surgery, not many patient/ hide the truth

M: should supply throughout our hospital system  
A: UC kill every kind of bacteria/ there are only one kind of bacteria   
P: many kind of bacteria that are more strong/ side effect when kill other kind  
S: experiment about UC to evry kind  

    4
M:UC kill more bateria in laboratory  
A: UC is better  
P: UC is highly dense, others is dilluted/ this highly densed will do harm to skin/ UC can do well in pracitical use  
S: same density and same dose

>**The following is a letter to the editor of an environmental magazine. 
"Two studies of amphibians in Xanadu National Park confirm a significant decline in the numbers of amphibians. In 1975 there were seven species of amphibians in the park, and there were abundant numbers of each species. However, in 2002 only four species of amphibians were observed in the park, and the numbers of each species were drastically reduced. One proposed explanation is that the decline was caused by the introduction of trout into the park's waters, which began in 1975. (Trout are known to eat amphibian eggs.)"**

    1
M: 1975 and 2002
A: studies under same condition

S: detailed information about two

    2
M: Trout was introduced
A: to eat eggs
P: two species are not in the same place/ Trout has die out/ Trout find a new prey
S: find Trout quantity and eating habit

    3
M: decline
A: Trout eat egg
P: other reason like environment/ predator/ pollution/ lack of food/ disease
S:

>**In a study of the reading habits of Waymarsh citizens conducted by the University of Waymarsh, most respondents said that they preferred literary classics as reading material. However, a second study conducted by the same researchers found that the type of book most frequently checked out of each of the public libraries in Waymarsh was the mystery novel. Therefore, it can be concluded that the respondents in the first study had misrepresented their reading habits.**
